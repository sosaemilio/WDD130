      <h2>Emilio Sosa</h2>
      <p>I am Emilio Sosa from Venezuela and currently enrolled in a Bachelor in Applied Technology. At present, I am working as a Project Manager in a Web Development Company in Virginia.</p>
      <p>This degree will help me to complement my career and technical background, one of the things I love about BYU-Idaho is its teaching model, it is helpful because it is flexible and focuses on building your technical skills.</p>
      <p>I love video games, and two of my favorites are Star Wars: The Old Republic and Pokemon Unite. I am a huge fan of Star Wars, Westworld, and Pokemon. My favorite movie is Interstellar.</p>
