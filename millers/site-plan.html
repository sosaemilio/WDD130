        <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
        <p>
          Millers is a global organization founded by a group of entrepreneurs while living in a country where the lack of opportunities led kids to leave school and stop looking for literacy. Many schools were abandoned, teachers didn't have the access to help their students, and they all believed education was not important. Education is one of the most important tools that can help a country to grow and become better a place if the opportunities are equal and we believe it must start from school. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We want all kids to be exposed to the joy of reading and understand the importance of education. To achieve our goal, we work in partnership with teachers, UNICEF, students, and other local activists to make books and education accessible and necessary.
