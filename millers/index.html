                "Our school was abandoned after the government stopped providing us with funds, we were the only basic school in our town of just 300 people, and many kids stayed at home. Millers helped us to rebuild the school, and send us requirements like books, desks, chairs, and pencils to start working again, our teacher volunteered to start teaching again."
